### General Info

*HoneyComb* (HoneyComblang or HoneyComb 0.0.1) is an **interperted, multidimensional, esoteric programming language** written in ***Python 3.13.7***, designed to resemble a **Honeycomb** in structural design using **multidimensional tapes** (3D). Designed with **simple**, **OS agnostic** and **lightweight** usage in mind, With similar syntax to traditional esolangs like *Brainfuck* it is not designed to handle actual real world case type coding, like any and all esoteric programming languages.

### Philosophy

*HoneyComb* was made in mind to **tackle dimensional limits** in common esolangs today and go far and beyond most dimensional scales pushing the tape dimensions of **3D** while resembiling a Honeycomb. Used also as a type of art language to showcase a **sense of nature** and **connectivity to earth** in a mechanical way (yes im totally ranting about nature deal about it)

### Usages

*HoneyComb* as mentioned before is ***NOT*** ment for any real use cases beyond being a joke language or an art language, and i ***DO*** incourage trying to build cool projects with it, it is not that applicable, modular or even sustainable to make real world projects with it.

Some examples include:

1. Random funny integrations with other languages to make a cool project.
2. Random pointer movement.
3. Studying esolangs or interperter theory.

Just to name a few.
