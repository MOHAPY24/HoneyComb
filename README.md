> 🧪 **HoneyComb** is a **multidimensional, esoteric programming language** inspired by the geometry of hexagonal grids.
> ✅ The **core interpreter** and **runtime grid** are complete!
> ⚡ Currently supports execution but not every planned feature yet.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🐝 **Multidimensional Program Flow** – execution moves like a honeycomb grid, not just linear.
* ⚙️ **Core Interpreter Finished** – stable foundation for building real programs.
* 🌀 **Runtime Grid Ready** – code executes within a fully functional honeycomb-based runtime.
* 💻 **Cross-Platform** – runs smoothly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* 🎨 **Esolang Aesthetic** – creative, unusual programming style for curious developers.

---

## 📌 Roadmap

* [x] Core interpreter
* [x] Honeycomb runtime grid
* [ ] More syntax features (conditionals, loops, data ops)
* [ ] Expanded standard library & utilities
* [ ] Tutorials, guides, and advanced examples

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MOHAPY24/HoneyComb.git
cd HoneyComb
python3 hyc.py docs/hi.hc
```

or

```bash
python3 hyc.py
```

if you wanna use the base REPL

*(Interpreter is stable, but some advanced features are still in progress.)*

---

## 🐝 Example

Here’s a tiny HoneyComb snippet (`hi.hc`) that demonstrates basic execution:

```hc
++++++++S++++++++,*>&+,
```

*(Syntax may evolve as more features roll out.)*

---

## 🛠️ Next Steps

* 🐜 Add flow-control constructs (loops, branching)
* 📦 Expand supported instructions
* 📝 Publish official documentation
* 🌍 Share example projects in the wild

## 🌟 Summary

HoneyComb is no longer just a prototype — it’s a **functional, production-ready esolang** 🐝.
If you’re into **weird languages, multidimensional execution, and esoteric compilers**, this is for you.
